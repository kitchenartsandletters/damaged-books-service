        <p>We received some copies of this book which are less than perfect. While supplies last, we are offering these copies at a reduced price.  These copies are first come, first served: we cannot reserve one for you. And we cannot predict when we might receive more once we sell out of them, mostly because we really don't want to get any more damaged copies. ðŸ˜Š</p>
        <p>When you order one of these books, we'll use our judgment to choose the best remaining copy for you in the category you choose. Purchases of damaged books are final sales: they are not refundable or exchangeable.</p>
